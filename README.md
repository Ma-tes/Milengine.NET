# Milengine.NET
Milengine is just yet another OpenGL "retro style" renderer/engine implementation. Futhermore the project started as a small learning project, which should not reach more then 1000 lines of code.
However I found out, that it is not possible to deploy easy to use engine, which would not act as a higher layer of OpenGL bindings.

### Implementation status
Currently every implementation is not going to stay as it is... The only file which is probably not going to be changed is [InlineParameter.cs](https://github.com/Ma-tes/Milengine.NET/blob/main/src/Milengine.NET/Core/Utilities/InlineOptimalizations/Buffers/InlineParameterBuffer/InlineParameter.cs).

## Project stage
Recently, I have been trying to find and also fix, rendering artefacts, which always appears from the center point of specific collection of meshes.
